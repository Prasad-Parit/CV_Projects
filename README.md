In this project we’ll dive into the intersection of technology ! we’ll look into an exciting journey into the world of image composition using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library in Python. This blog will be your gateway to mastering the art of seamless image blending.

Implementation:
Let’s directly jump into the coding part, we will explore the code step by step and see the output of it.

Firstly install OpenCV Library using the code

pip install opencv-python
1. Import OpenCV:
import cv2
This line imports the OpenCV library, which is a popular computer vision library in Python.

2. Loading Images:
image1 = cv2.imread('image1.jpg') image2 = cv2.imread('image2.jpg')
The code reads two images (‘image1.jpg’ and ‘image2.jpg’) using the cv2.imread function and stores them in the variables image1 and image2.

3. Ensure Same Dimensions:
image2 = cv2.resize(image2, (image1.shape[1], image1.shape[0]))
This line ensures that both images have the same dimensions. It resizes image2 to have the same width and height as image1 using the cv2.resize function.

4. Combine Images Horizontally:
combined_img = cv2.hconcat([image1, image2])
The code horizontally concatenates the two images using the cv2.hconcat function and stores the result in the variable combined_img.

5. Save Combined Image:
cv2.imwrite('combined_img.jpg', combined_img)
This line saves the combined image as ‘combined_img.jpg’ using the cv2.imwrite function.

6. Display Combined Image:
cv2.imshow('Combined Image', combined_img) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows()
These lines display the combined image using cv2.imshow, wait for a key press with cv2.waitKey(0), and then close the display windows with cv2.destroyAllWindows().
